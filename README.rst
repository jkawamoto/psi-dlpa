Distributed Laplace Perturbation Algorithm
==========================================

|GPLv3| |Release|

Client and server applications providing Distributed Laplace
Perturbation Algorithm (DLPA).

The DLPA has been introduced by `Vibhor
Rastogi <https://www.linkedin.com/in/vibhor-rastogi-6b680152>`__ and
`Suman Nath <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumann/>`__
in "`Differentially Private Aggregation of Distributed Time-Series with
Transformation and
Encryption <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1807247>`__," and
published in `SIGMOD 2010 <http://www.sigmod2010.org/index.shtml>`__.

Client
------

This package has client class ``dlpa.DLPAClient``. To create an
instance, the constructor takes two arguments:

-  host: Address of a DLPA server,
-  port: Port number of the DLPA server.

Although the client class implements several protocols defined in DLPA,
``get_key`` and ``encrypt_noisy_sum`` are the only method users might
have interest.

The ``get_key`` requests a client key to the server. It takes one
argument, client ID, and returns a client key object.

The other method ``encrypt_noisy_sum`` runs the Entryp-Noisy-Sum
protocol, which is the key protocol of DLPA. It takes the following four
arguments:

-  ck: Client key.
-  client\_id: Client ID.
-  value: Scalar or vector to be sent to the server by Encrypt-Sum
   protocol.
-  epsilon: Parameter to generate Laplace noises.

and returns a time slot when the request is attached.

Server
------

``dlpa-server`` command runs a server application of DLPA. The following
is the usage of this command:

::

    usage: dlpa-server [-h] --port PORT --clients NCLIENT
                       [--max-workers MAX_WORKERS] [--key-length M_LENGTH]
                       [--time-span SPAN]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --port PORT           Listening port number.
      --clients NCLIENT     The number of clients.
      --max-workers MAX_WORKERS
                            The maximum number of workers (default: 10).
      --key-length M_LENGTH
                            Bit length of the secret key (default: 2048).
      --time-span SPAN      Second of one time slot.

Note that the port number and the number of clients are necessary
arguments.

You can also starts a server from another python script by using
``dlpa.server`` function. The function takes the following keyword
arguments:

-  port: Port number the created server listen.
-  max\_workers: The maximum number of workers.
-  nclient: The number of clients connecting this server.
-  m\_length: Bit length of the secret key.

and returns a server object, which has a method ``stop(t)`` to stop the
server within the given time ``t``. Callers are responsible for calling
the method to close the server.

Installation
------------

::

    $ pip install --upgrade psi-dlpa

Additionaly, if you install
`gmpy2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2>`__, computation time will be
reduced. To install gmpy2 in mac, you also need to install mpc, mpfr,
and libmp. Those three packages are available in
`Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__.
